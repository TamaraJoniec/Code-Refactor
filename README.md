# Code-Refactor

Scouting and refactoring code from a marketing agency website to enhance accessibility and maintainability.

## Overview

This project involved taking existing code and enhancing it with the following goals in mind:

- Improve code semantics.
- Increase accessibility for all users, especially those using screen readers or other assistive technologies.
- Ensure the site remains fully functional and visually unchanged.
- Optimize CSS for readability and performance.

## Key Changes

1. **HTML Enhancements**:
   - Used semantic HTML5 elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`.
   - Ensured all images have descriptive `alt` attributes for improved accessibility.
   - Structured the HTML content in a logical and readable order.

2. **CSS Optimizations**:
   - Grouped and combined redundant CSS selectors.
   - Organized CSS to follow the structure of the HTML.
   - Added comments to describe sections and functionality.

## Conclusion

Through this refactoring process, the website's codebase is now more efficient, accessible, and easier to maintain. Future developers working on this site will find it more straightforward to understand and modify.
